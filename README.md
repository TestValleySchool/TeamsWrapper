# TeamsWrapper

Simple, hacky program to launch, in order of preference:

 * the local instance of Teams for the logged in user
 * the system-wide Teams installer if present, followed by the new local instance of Teams

This provides us with a single executable to which a shortcut can be made which ensures that
Teams will always launch, or install for the user, then launch.
